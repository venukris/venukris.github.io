Hello! :wave: I'm Venu, a Senior Software Engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I specialize in developing tools and pipeline that empower artists to create digital visual effects for film and television. Currently at [Weta FX](https://www.wetafx.co.nz), my focus is with the Creatures department, where I help bring epic fantasies like [Avatar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630029/) and [Kingdom of the Apes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389872/) to life. You can find a comprehensive overview of my career and projects on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venukrishnamurthy/).

I envision this website as a hybrid space, blending my professional work and personal projects with my interests in investing, travel, books, and podcasts, alongside various musings on life.
